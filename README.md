# Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning: A Stacked Classifier Approach  

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning solution for predicting employee attrition. Employee turnover poses significant challenges for organizations, impacting productivity and incurring financial costs. Using machine learning, we analyze employee attrition on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset from Kaggle, which includes 35 features such as Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, and Salary Hike percentage.  

## Key Features  
- **Dataset**: IBM HR Analytics dataset with 35 attributes.  
- **Algorithms**: Evaluated multiple supervised classification algorithms.  
- **Optimal Model**: Stacked Classifier combining Adaptive Boosting, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine, achieving a high accuracy of 90.65%.
